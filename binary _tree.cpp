//a bianary search is only possible when the arrays areaa given is a increasing or decrreasing order 
// so basically the cimputer takes the centre n/2 value and check if the value that is supposed to be foud
//is more than the mddle value r not...
//suppose its an increaasaing list and the middle value is 10 and the value we are searching for is 15
// so the computer elimanes all the values before 10 cz 15>10 and then the compier runs this sorting again 
//this time with 10 as the starting value and something else on the centre 

//for a bianary tree the same thing happens 
// that tree for that either hasa to be on a decending or on an ascending order 
//it sorts with the help of levels
