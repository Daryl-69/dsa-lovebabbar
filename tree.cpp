  2.root: the topmost node in a tree is caller root node 

  3.parent any node and children node: while compairing 2 or more nodes, any node on  is the parent node
  and the one on bottom is the children node

  4.siibling: two 'bottom' nodes that has the same PARENT

  5. ancestot: node(s) above the parent node(s)
  
  6.decendor: node(S)below the children node(S)

  7. leaf node: node(S) that are the bottomost i.e thay do not have any child node


  the most child a bianary tree can have is 2
